<h1>Native JS + Python + Flask Full Stack Framework</h1>

To start, make sure you install first the python then run the below command

<code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code>

<h2>What is this?</h2>

<p>I called this a real JavaScript Full Stack framework. A very light framework for your non-reloadable website.</p>

<p>If you are looking for a pure JS full stack to build your system, then this is the framework you are looking for! You can integrate any CDN resources or local resources just like you loaded it manually.</p>

<p>It supports SEO dynamic meta data just like a normal pages. So, you don't have to worry it, it's just like you just transforming your current website to non-reloadable pages but SEO friendly.</p>
